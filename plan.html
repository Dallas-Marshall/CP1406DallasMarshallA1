<h2>Name: Dallas Marshall</h2>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>

    their Kirwan bakery
</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
    <li>Visiting the Kirwan Bakery to purchase products</li>
    <li>Signing up to the weekly specials, and also taking advantage of these specials (ordering more)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>
    As outlined in the Introductory email, the business plans to attract young families and young people around the
    ages of 17 - 35. The website will target this audience by incorporating social media links to connect with
    millennial's as well as having high resolution images that millennial's have come to expect when visiting websites.
    Millennial's are also interested in eco-friendly and charitable initiates so website must show aspects of these,
    such as an Instagram feed of the company with nice looking layouts of food as well as bio-friendly cups and
    take-away
    utensils. Furthermore, a minimalist / earthy tone for colours will be used to try and further engage more target
    customers
